# Application Flow

Now a brief overview of how all our moving parts will work together. There are a lot of different ideas and technologies involved in this application that it is easy to get mixed up with them all. In our diagram below, we explain a bit of the separation of tasks and how the parts tie in together.

Angular is on its own in the frontend. It accesses all the data it needs through the Node API. Node hits the database and returns JSON information to Angular based on the RESTful routing.

This way, you can separate the frontend application from the actual API. If you want to extend the API, you can always build more routes and functions into it without affecting the frontend Angular application. This way you can eventually build different apps on different platforms since you just have to hit the API.
